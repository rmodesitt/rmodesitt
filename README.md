I am a data enthusiast and analysis fanatic who has recently entered the world of data science! I have been a business analyst and product owner the past 5 years, and am now using the skillsets from these roles to look at data in new ways using data visualization, machine learning algorithms, and predictive modeling. I have worked on many projects using Python and SQL. Currently, I am furthering my knowledge and practical experience in deep learning and neural networks.
